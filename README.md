This event reminder app is a place where users can follow there favorite artists to recive real time updates for future events.

users can find artists and follow them to recive notifications from them, they can also look at there currently planned events and there location and if there are tickets available.

when an artist announces a new event that a user is following they will recive an alert about it so they can be the first ones to purchase a ticket

Supabase still isnt connected yet(working on that RN) so to see the skeleton just launch on the main screen you can reload to see it again. You can see the artists cards shimmering mocking the data loading 

Apple HIGs:
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens are used to show content immediately while data loads. Following HIG guidelines, the app displays placeholder animations (shimmer effects) allowing users to be able to see that something is loading This creates a smoother, more responsive user experience.

- **Haptic Feedback**: Haptic feedback is used on certain buttons so that the user can get more feedback when using the app. Its used consistently on pressable buttons, and isnt overused on everything. It is used on the back button, event cards and the toggle buttons.
