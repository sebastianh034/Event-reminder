To use notifications click on any artist events and a notification will appear, this is just for testing, in the future the notifucations will be for any event updates or similar stuff

google signin needs to be attached to an account and then you will be able to sign in with google, apple signing doesnt work untill I get a dev account.

when an account is signed in they can see there upcomming events in the home page instead of having to go to there profile and they can scroll to the left to see artists to follow
